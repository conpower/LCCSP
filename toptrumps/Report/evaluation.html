      <h2 class="w3-padding-16">Project Evaluation - Top Trumps Airplanes</h2>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-8">Overall, the Top Trumps Airplanes game project is a fun and engaging interactive experience that lets players compete with each other in a game of chance and strategy. The project meets the basic requirements by allowing players to fully interact with the game, selecting their chosen attribute, card, and number of players. Additionally, the game includes an element of randomness that ensures each round is unique and exciting.
      </h5>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-8">
One of the most important features of the game is that each player receives an equal amount of cards, which are shuffled randomly for fairness. This adds an extra level of excitement and ensures that players have an equal chance of winning the game.
      </h5>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-8">
The game is easy to use and can be played in three different modes: single player, multiplayer, and simulation. It has been designed with intuitive use interface.
      </h5>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-8">
The advanced requirements of the project have also been met, including the ability to store results data in the window local storage, and the development of algorithms that perform statistical analysis and communicate the resulting information in a graphical format. This allows players to track their progress and analyse their strategies, making the game even more engaging and challenging.
      </h5>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-8">
In terms of the planning I did, I think it worked pretty well. I have been able to implement all what I planned except some small details such as the wins counter.
      </h5>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-8">
However, there are some bad aspects of the game that I would improve if I was to do it again. For instance, the test failed consisted on testing if the game allows for tie-breakers, what the game does in this situation is just giving a new pair of cards to each player, it basically skips the round. What I would do to improve it is to implement a function that allows the player to compare a second stat if the first chosen ties. 
      </h5>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-8">
Also, a function that I would like to implement to my game in the future is a text to speech function or sound effects to improve its <strong>accessibility</strong>. 
      </h5>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-8">
In conclusion, the Top Trumps Airplanes project is a successful implementation of an interactive game that meets all basic and advanced requirements. It provides a fun and engaging experience for players of all ages and levels, and its intuitive design and fair gameplay ensure that it is accessible to everyone.
